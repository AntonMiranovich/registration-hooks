# registration-hooks
This project is the implementation of a user registration and authorization system using HTML, CSS, React and Material-UI.

The registration and authorization system plays an important role in most web applications, allowing users to create accounts, log in to the site, and access secure areas and features. The project allows you to create such a system using the popular React framework and the third-party Material-UI library to create stylish and attractive user interfaces.

In your project, you'll use HTML to create the page structure, CSS to style UI elements, and React to control the dynamics and functionality of the application. Material-UI provides you with ready-made components and styles to simplify the design process and create an attractive interface.

To register a new user, you can use a form where users will enter their name, email address and password. After filling out the form, they will send the data to the server to create a new account. Upon successful registration, the user will be given access to protected sections of the site.

To authorize existing users, you can use the login form to enter the email address and password associated with the user account. Upon submitting the form, the data will be verified on the server, and if the authorization is successful, the user will be redirected to a secure page where he can interact with the functions of your application.

Using HTML, CSS, React and Material-UI, you can create an effective registration and login system that will provide security and ease of use for your users.
